    I bought an LG LED TV television 2yrs ago and it developed a fault during its warranty period. I reported the matter to the dealer who refused to address the issue. I then filed a formal complaint to the CPC who investigated the matter and directed the dealer to replace the 42inch LED TV. To my greatest surprise, the dealer replaced the TV with a 43Inch in place of the 42Inch TV because they didnt have any other option. I am proud of the CPC.
