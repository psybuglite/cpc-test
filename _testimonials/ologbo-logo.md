    I bought a plot of land in Abuja from an Estate firm for a huge amount of money in Abuja. The estate firm refused to assign me the plot of land that I paid for and refused to refund my money for more than 2 years. They even dared me to take the case to the police or to court. I reported to the CPC and I got a full refund of my money without paying a dime to the CPC.
