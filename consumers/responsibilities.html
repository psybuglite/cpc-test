          <h1>Your Responsibilities as a Consumer</h1>
          <p>
            Total consumer protection is a collective effort, its actualization demands
            collective input from not just manufacturers, service providers and
            Government, but also from the consumer. The consumer has the responsibility
            to:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong class="green-text">Beware</strong>: be alert to the quality and safety of goods and services before you
            purchase.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong class="green-text">Be Aware</strong>: gather all the information and facts available about a product or
            service as well as keep abreast of changes and innovations in the market.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong class="green-text">Think Independently</strong>: make decisions about well- considered needs and wants
            Speak Out: inform manufacturers and Government of your needs and
            expectation
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong class="green-text">Complain</strong>: inform business and other consumers in a fair and honest manner
            about your dissatisfaction and satisfaction with a product or service
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong class="green-text">Be an Ethical Consumer</strong>: be fair and never engage in dishonest practices,
            which costs all consumer money
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong class="green-text">Respect Environment</strong>: avoid waste ,littering and contributing to pollution. It is
            hoped that as consumers become aware of their rights and responsibility, and
            report any unremedied infringement to the Council, the dynamics of a free
            market economy will be triggered off to generate a better sustainable, thriving
            and growing economy in the nation. Such would remove wasteful
            expenditures, reduce poverty as value for money gets assured.
