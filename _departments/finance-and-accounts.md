  The Department is responsible for the financial operations of the Council. These include preparation and defence of the annual budgets, expenditure planning and execution, maintenance of the Council’s internal control, record keeping and management. Considering the size and magnitude of the daily operations of the Council and zonal offices, this department plays a vital role in ensuring that the mandate of the Council is achieved without delay or hitches.
