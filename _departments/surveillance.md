The Surveillance and Enforcement Department is a key operational unit of the Council. The department hosts and manages the complaint resolution function of the Council and the surveillance and enforcement activities of the Council. In resolving complaints, the department participates in simple resolutions, negotiations, mediation, conciliation and investigations. As part of the outcome of complaint resolution, beyond modifying behaviour, the department on behalf of the Council secures remedies for consumers including compensation, repair, replacements or restitution where applicable.

The department’s monitoring activities extend to ensuring that providers and producers do not engage in misleading advertisement and making appropriate and sufficient disclosures. Sales promotion continues to be a trick area raising the question of transparency and disclosures. The department is responsible for assessing and approving promotions, and evaluating the conduct of the promotion after the promotion or when consumers complain. The department leads the Council’s effort in monitoring and reporting market trends and is responsible for input into key publications and orders of the Council such as banned products list, product recalls, where applicable and compliance with international and domestic disclosure, warning standards and regulations.

Some of the undercover and sting operations of the department have resulted in seizure and confiscation of otherwise hazardous or substandard goods, and prevented others from entering the stream of trade. The key interface between operational departments and other regulators is the Surveillance and Enforcement Department.
