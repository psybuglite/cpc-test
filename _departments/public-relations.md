The Public Relations Unit is the vital conduit between the Council and the public. Operating from the Office of The Director General, the unit is responsible for the entire communications value chain of the Council, both internal and external. As the image manager of the Council, the PR Unit coordinates strategic communication, engages in crisis and perception management where necessary and manages the Council’s presence on multiple platforms. The sensitive role and balance this unit plays is best underscored by the operations of other departments such as Surveillance &amp; Enforcement and Consumer Education who use the various communication channels and platforms to discharge their responsibilities.

In addition, maintaining and expanding the Council’s relationship with both traditional and new media in a fast moving and dynamic environment, covering multiple sectors and gathering information about developments for timely releases or intervention are some of the daily round the clock responsibilities of the Public relations Unit.
