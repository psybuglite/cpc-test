main: "The Surveillance and Enforcement (S &amp; E) Department is a key operational
  arm of the Council that manages complaint resolution, surveillance and enforcement
  activities. In resolving complaints, the department deploys negotiation, mediation,
  conciliation and investigation. As part of the outcome of complaint resolution,
  beyond modifying behaviour, the department secures remedies for consumers, such
  as compensation, repair, replacements or refund, where applicable. \n\nThe department’s
  monitoring activities extend to ensuring that service providers and producers do
  not engage in misleading advertisement and that they make appropriate and sufficient
  disclosures. Sales promotion continues to be a potential tricky area, raising the
  question of transparency and disclosures. The department is responsible for assessing
  and approving sales promotions, and evaluating their conduct during and after conclusion
  or when consumers complain. The department leads the Council’s effort in monitoring
  and reporting market trends and is responsible for input into key publications and
  orders of the Council such as banned products list, products recall, where applicable
  and compliance with international and domestic disclosure, standards and regulations.
  \n\nThe key interface between operational departments and sector specific regulators
  is the Surveillance and Enforcement Department."
