Our attention has been drawn to a publication suggesting that the Consumer Protection Council (CPC) secured judgment in the sum of N17 Million against Coca-Cola from the Supreme Court of Nigeria. 

Although the story factually reports that the current Director General of the CPC prior to his appointment as Director General was a partner at SimmonsCooper Partners, and in that role, represented the respondent in that Appeal (Mrs Titilayo Akisanya) in this case, which emanated from the National Industrial Court as far back as 2012. 

The subject of the litigation appears to be a private employment dispute between Coca Cola and Akisanya. The conflict was not about, or on account of a consumer issue or failure. There was no underlying complaint or apparent statutory jurisdiction of the CPC. Essentially, the only connection of the CPC to this case is that the courtâ€™s decision was delivered by the Supreme Court at a time after counsel of record, Babatunde Irukera was appointed by the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as Director General of the CPC, even though he previously argued the case before this appointment. 

Indeed, Coca Cola, like any other company is within the consumer protection jurisdiction of the CPC, this case was not about any such issue and the CPC neither contributed nor participated in the dispute or judicial process.
